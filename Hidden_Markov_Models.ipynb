        "The Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution []. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called transition probabilities. (http://jedlik.phy.bme.hu/~gerjanos/HMM/node4.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "A hidden markov model works with probabilities to predict future events or states. In this section we will learn how to create a hidden markov model that can predict the weather.\n",
        "\n",
        "This section is based on the following TensorFlow tutorial. https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/HiddenMarkovModel\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "Let's start by discussing the type of data we use when we work with a hidden markov model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous sections we worked with large datasets of 100's of different entries. For a markov model we are only interested in probability distributions that have to do with states.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can find these probabilities from large datasets or may already have these values. We'll run through an example in a second that should clear some things up, but let's discuss the components of a markov model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**States**: In each markov model we have a finite set of states. These states could be something like warm and cold or high and low or even red, green and blue. These states are hidden within the model, which means we do not direcly observe them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observations**: Each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution. An example of this is the following: On a hot day Tim has a 80% chance of being happy and a 20% chance of being sad.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transitions**: Each state will have a probability defining the likelyhood of transitioning to a different state. An example is the following: a cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day and a 70% chance of being follwed by another cold day.\n",
        "\n",
